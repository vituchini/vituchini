Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Front-End developer from Ukraine, with 8+ years of experience as a Software Developer specializing in UI development, Content Management Systems(CMS), and in the areas including Internet/Intranet technology, client/server, and multitier applications.

I work with my clients, efficiently, clearly defining their needs and itâ€™s a primary goal of mine to manage expectations. I do not up-sell my clients on frivolous things, I do not take on work that I do not fully understand and I make it a priority to make sure that anyone I work with will know what they are going to get.

Looking for a long-term, full-time project! Feel free to contact me if you need my help!
