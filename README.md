Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Viktor, a Front-End Developer from Ukraine with over 5 years of experience in front-end development and 8+ years as a Software Developer. I specialize in creating intuitive user interfaces, developing Content Management Systems (CMS), and building scalable web applications across various platforms, including Internet/Intranet and client-server environments.

My approach is client-focused: I prioritize understanding your needs and delivering solutions that meet expectations without unnecessary upsells or commitments beyond my expertise. Clear communication and transparency are essential to my work, ensuring you always know what to expect.

Iâ€™m currently seeking long-term, full-time projects and would love to help bring your vision to life. Letâ€™s collaborate!

Feel free to reach out!
